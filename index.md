## Privacy Policy

Lone Dev built the Japin app as an Ad Supported app. This SERVICE is provided by Lone Dev at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Japin unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collection and Use**

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to email, birthday, gender, location. The information that I request will not be used for any service offered by the app right now but may be used in future for targeted advertisements. The reasons and scope of the information that you provide for the services is described as follows.
* Email is used to uniquely create a profile for a user, Japin does not verify email and it does not send any promotional email as of now. The email is only accessed to send user password reset link in case the user forgets his/her password and requests for to reset it. Japin uses Google Firebase as the backend service provider and the email-password tuple is used for user authentication but identification does not uses email rather it uses a random id provided by Firebase that is anonymous and is only linked with the email in a secure (security provided by Google Firebase) database. 
* Birthday, gender and location provided by the user is not used for any purpose by Japin and its back-end services as of now but it may be used in future for targeted advertisements. It should be noted that these data provided by the user is not verified in any way by Japin (including location) thus Japin cannot be blamed for false data furnished by anyone. These data are visible by default to admirers/profile viewers of a user in his/her profile but the visibility can be altered by the user from the app. 
* Location is a combination of country and city (with optional details like area/town/village etc.) provided by the user and is not verified by any location services. 
* Japin allows users of all age above 13 to Japin. Birthday is just collected as a part of profile content for now but may be used later for age based ad serving.

Apart from these the app needs some hardware permissions, some of which are asked during use of specific hardware services and some of which are enabled on installation, details are as follows.
* INTERNET PERMISSION: Japin uses internet for communicatting with the back-end and thus provide most of its services. It is set by default when the app is installed.
* CAMERA PERMISSION: Japin uses camera only when the user chooses to shoot a photo through Japin camera for posting or saving to the device, by default permission is not granted and the user has to grant permission on first use of the camera after installation.
* READ AND WRITE STORAGE DATA: Japin requires storage access permission to read images for uploading and writing images that are edited by Japin. By default the permission is not set and the user is prompted to give the permission on first image selection, during the first edit/setup of profile.

The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

**Picture Privacy Specific to Japin Services**

* Japin allows users to share pictures. These pictures are only visible to users who admires a user in Japin and users who opens the profile of the user in Japin. The transfer and storage of pictures are handeled by Google Firebase along with its available security measures. Pictures are loaded using Picasso library in the app.
* Japin allows users to select the option of sharing a picture to on or off. In general users cannot share thier own picture or pictures of any user who have not allowed sharing of the picture. A picture cannot be saved from the app directly however users can perform operations like screenshot etc. to sae others pictures, Japin has no control on it for now.
* Content of picture is not filtered by Japin and thus it does not filter out contents based on vulgurity, violence, etc. A user has the option of unadmiring any user who posts such pictures in order to make those disappear from his/her wall. For now reporting any post or picture is not suppoted in Japin as there is no option of public posting. Pictures of users and users who are being admired, are only visible to a user. 
* Japin does not store any picture after it is retired but a users picture shot and/or edited through Japin are saved by default to the users device and is not deleted by Japin in any time ven after uninstalling the app.
* Japin does not store profile and cover pictures of users after they are changed by the user, it is the sole responsibility of the user to have the picture stored in their devices. Japin only allows selecting pictures for the operations and users cannot shoot a picture to upload them as their profile or cover picture as of now, so by default a copy of that picture always remains in the device.
* Japin allows users to update the picture description and delete it withing its life anytime. Users cannot update or delete others pictures or descriptions. Comments posted by users on any picture follows the same rule with the caveat that comments can only be deleted not updated as of now.
* Japin does not allow users to view te indivitual raters of his/her pictures as of now, the total star count is shown and the rating bar shows the rating given by the user who is currently viewing the picture.
* Japin does not use any cloud function to delete pictures after they are retired. Pictures are deleted only when any audience of the picture (at the time of retiring) opens the app. Once a picture is deleted medal count is updated, thus there may be a delay between a picture getting retired and the medal being awarded to the user. However it should be noted that any user is his/her audience by default.
* Admiring in Japin is not a two way connection i.e. if a user admires another user then by default the second user is not made the admirer of the first user. It is the sole choice of the user whether they want to admire someone or not.

## Terms & Conditions

By signing up for the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Lone Dev.

Lone Dev is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app from time to time. Japin is a free app supported by ads, we do not have any plan to remove app by paid subscription in near future, but if such a decision is taken, you have the right to opt for a free ad supported plan or a paid ad free plan. Nothing will be imposed on you without your explicit permission.

The Japin app stores personal data that you have provided to us, but it does not process it in the backend for any service. The email provided acts as a unique key for your account/profile, the name, date of birth, gender and location is collected from you but are not processed for any service now, in the future these data can be used for targeted advertisement. Japin does not allow anyone including developer and service providers to see individual data at any time and even if personal data is used, it will be used anonymously for analytical purpose. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Japin app won’t work properly or at all.

You should be aware that there are certain things that Lone Dev will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Lone Dev cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

Along the same lines, Lone Dev cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Lone Dev cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to Lone Dev’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Lone Dev accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. For backend services, Japin uses Google Firebase and capabilities of this app is limited in some areas for the limitations in backend which is decscribed in details later. Lone Dev does not accuse or blame any third party service for their technical limitations and all limitations of Japin may not be due to those only. The developer/developers will try their best to remove many drawbacks in future, but I should also mention that all drawbacks are not due to technical limitations of developer/developers but are also caused by limitations of third party services as well. Lone Dev does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

**Changes to This Terms and Conditions**

I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

**Terms and Conditions Specific to Japin Services and Limitations**
Japin is a social networking app, with focus on pictures, which is currently available on android only. The app uses android services along with services from other open-source libraries. For back-end operations Japin uses Google Firebase services for user authentication and data storage. The app is created by Lone Dev, an app creator from India. The following paragraphs depicts the terms and conditions of using the app. 

**Services offered by Japin**
* Japin allows users to create profile for posting pictures. Users can have a square profile picture and a 4:3 landscape cover picture for their profile. Users have to register with an email, Japin does not verify user email and it does not send any email to user for now. Japin only uses the email to send a password reset link when the user requests for one from the forgot password activity. 
* Japin allows users to enter their display name (it need not be unique for each user), their birthday, gender and location as a combination of country and city (with additional precision like area, village, town etc. as optional). Users have the control to make the data visible or invisible to others.
* Japin allows users to post pictures with descriptions. Pictures can be shot from the Japin app itself in 3:4 portrait mode, 1:1 square mode and 4:3 landscape mode. For now Japin allows these modes for picture only.
* Japin allows users to edit their shot or uploaded picture with various filters before posting, there is no language barrier in the description and users can also include emojis, urls etc. in the description. For now Japin does not have any hastag based aggregation feature.
* Japin allows users to rate their own and others pictures in a scale of 1 to 5. Users can also comment on the posts of their own and of others. Users can also share others pictures, if they allow it to be shared, but cannot share their own pictures.
* Pictures in Japin stays on the network based on the number of admirers (or followers) the user have, at the time of posting the picture termed as fixed life, and on the total stars garnered by the picture, known as variable life. Pictures of users admired by the user appears on the laters wall sorted by popularity i.e the life of the picture and then its freshness.
* Japin allows users to earn medals according the number of stars each picture has achieved at the time of retirement. If a picture retires with more than or equal to 100 stars the users earns a bronze medal. Similarly for 1000 and 10000 stars users earn a silver and gold medal respectively. 
* Japin allows users to showcase their pictures (not limited to any category) to their admirers only, there is no public posting service by Japin as of now. 

**Limitations of Japin**
* Japin has a limitation on the number of admirers a user can have or the number of persons the user can admire, both capped at 5000 as of now. A user is self admiring by default so that number can be described as 4999 to be precise. This is due the limitation of Firebase queries on collections. Though theoretically 10000 limit can be achieved, the cap is fixed at 5000 to keep the experience snappier. The developer/developers will try their best to remove this cap on future updates with the advancement of Firebase queries but the developer/developers is not commiting on a precise date after which this update will happen.
* Japin search by name is limited to precise case sensitive search from beginning only. That is, if the user is searching for “John Doe”, the search string can be “J”, “Jo”, “Joh” etc. strings like “j”, “jO”, “doe”, “DOE” etc. will not work. This is due to the query limitations by firebase but it can be resolved through third party services. The developer/developers will try their best to remove this limitation on future updates but the developer/developers is not commiting on a precise date after which this update will happen.
* Japin has the limitation on the total size of comments on every picture due to back end restrictions. Though upto 1000 big comments(500 to 600 characters) or 2000 small comments(250 to 300 characters) can be easily achieved, performance will lag after that due to the large size of comment document. This is also due to Firebase sub-collection handling limitations as of now but with future updates and improvement of Firebase capabilities this will be handled in future versions.
* Japin pictures are limited to 3 fixed aspect ratios as of now, with future updates this will increase.
* As of now Japin does not allow users to post multiple pictures (or an album) in a single post. The developer/developers will try to remove this in future updates.
* Picture sharing in Japin allows users to share pictures of users they are admiring, but as of now sharing means making a new post with all aspects of the post being shared kept same, with just the life and audience in accordance to the user sharing the picture. The picture will not appear in the profile of the user who shared the picture rather it will be shown in the profile of the original owner of the picture with just the name of the user who shared the picture, above it. The developer/developers will try to make the sharing experience more versatile in future updates.
* Japin does not support replying to user comments as of now, also comments can be deleted only not updated. Also there is no notification regarding anything on Japin as of now. The developer/developers will try to eliminate this restrictions and enhance user engagement in future updates.
* The backend of Japin is powered by Google Firebase and there are overall restrictions on the number of reads and write operation on Japin on a daily basis. Though with few millions parallel users there will be no issue, if the number of parallel users increase to multiples of tens of millions, issues may arise. The developer/developers hope that the issue will be tackled with time.
* Japin is developed as a general platform android app without keeping device specific requirements in mind as of now. Thus performance of device specific services like camera can vary from device to device and the default autofocus and auto exposure may not work well in all devices. Also performance variation due to variation in hardware specification of devices or OS configurations is not the liability of Japin.
